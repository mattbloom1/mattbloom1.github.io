      <p>
        Jo-Vaughn Virginie Scott was born on January 20, 1995, and was the first
        of his immediate Caribbean family to be born in the United States.[7]
        His maternal family originated from the Caribbean island of St.
        Lucia,[8] while his paternal family originates from the island of
        Jamaica.[9] He was born in the East Flatbush section of Brooklyn, New
        York City. He was raised in Bed-Stuy and attended the Edward R. Murrow
        High School.[10] He originally enrolled at Edward R. Murrow to study
        acting, but transitioned towards music around the time of 9th grade,
        with a focus on rapping.[11] He started rapping under the name
        "JayOhVee", but eventually changed it to Joey Badass. He says that the
        name change is due to the media's focus on rappers with more cynical
        names, saying it was "what sounded cool at the time, what fit [his]
        mood".[12] He began writing poetry and songs at the age of 11.[12][13]
        Along with CJ Fly, he is a founding member of the collective known as
        Progressive Era, or Pro Era for short,[12][14] which was formed by his
        high school friends Capital Steez and Powers Pleasant.[15][16]
